My Python project code I am submitting for my application to Stony Brook University Computational Linguistics M.A. Program

To run the code I have provided, you need a "credentials file" which you can get as a member of Stony Brook University with this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/160k9_HKPqzbKkJ-A0ZQCIs8dPK_QD95k?usp=sharing

Please do not share/reduplicate 

Note: certain files such as your "credentials file" need to be located in certain places/folders which are labeled in the code. 
I believe the credentials file is found in C:\\NOA

To run the code properly, you also need the document titled "12345_ABC1234.jpg" which represents an NOA with conventional naming
"Annotated NOA.pdf" is a copy of the same file which is labeled to help you understand where I am talking about with certain topics
