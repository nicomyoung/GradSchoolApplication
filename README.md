My Python project code I am submitting for my application to Stony Brook University Computational Linguistics M.A. Program

To run the code I have provided, you need a "credentials file" which you can get as a member of Stony Brook University with this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/160k9_HKPqzbKkJ-A0ZQCIs8dPK_QD95k?usp=sharing
The appropriate Lib folder is also located there, containing the correct versions of the libraries I use in my code

Please do not share/reduplicate 

Note: certain files such as your "credentials file" need to be located in certain places/folders which are labeled in the code. 
I believe the credentials file is found in C:\\NOA

To run the code properly, you also need the document titled "12345_ABC1234.jpg" which represents an NOA with conventional naming
"Annotated NOA.pdf" is a copy of the same file which is labeled to help you understand where I am talking about with certain topics 

To run the code properly, compile in entirety and run the "docScan()" function, select the JPG file I provided once prompted. When selecting case info or money to process each, click the section you wish to process on the GUI, once the GUI disappears click once at the top left and then once at the bottom right of the section (where I labeled the red bounding boxes for you in the Annotated NOA). 
Case Info requires 2 clicks. Money on the other hand requires 4 clicks, 2 clicks for each of the bounding boxes as shown in the Annotated NOA. Always click top left to bottom right. 
If the results do not pop up for some reason, feel free to terminate the program and restart.
