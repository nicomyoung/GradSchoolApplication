My Python project code I am submitting for my application to Stony Brook University Computational Linguistics M.A. Program

To run the code I have provided, you need a "credentials file" which you can get as a member of Stony Brook University with this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/160k9_HKPqzbKkJ-A0ZQCIs8dPK_QD95k?usp=sharing

Please do not share/reduplicate 

Note: certain files such as your "credentials file" need to be located in certain places/folders which are labeled in the code. 
I believe the credentials file is found in C:\\NOA
